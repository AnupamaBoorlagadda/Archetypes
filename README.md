#Archtypes
* I wanted to publish a variety of Archetypes to help quicken project creation.


##GWT ArcheTypes
* [GWT Basic](https://github.com/branflake2267/Archetypes/tree/master/archetypes/gwt-basic) - Simple GWT setup


##More Archetypes
* [GWT-Platform Archetypes](https://github.com/ArcBees/ArcBees-tools/tree/master/archetypes) - Setup some GWT-Platform project Archetypes from here.


##News
* 1/14/2013 - Create this project. Created a GWT basic archetype. 


##Incubating
These archetype projects are in the works and need some tuning. 

* [GWT App Engine Guice JPA1](https://github.com/branflake2267/Archetypes/tree/master/archetypes/gwt-appengine-guice-jpa1) - Basic GWT and App Engine using guice with JPA1
